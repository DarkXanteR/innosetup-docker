##About
A Docker Image running [Wine](https://www.winehq.org) and [WiX](http://wixtoolset.org) for creating windows installer packages (msi).

##Usage

##Maintenance
The image is build on Docker hub with [Automated builds](http://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/). Also a [repository link](http://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/#repository-links) to its parent image is configured. So it is automatically updated, when the parent image is updated.

##Copyright free
The sources in [this](https://github.com/suchja/wix-toolset.git) Github repository, from which the docker image is build, are copyright free (see LICENSE.md). Thus you are allowed to use the sources (e.g. Dockerfile and README.md) in which ever way you like.
